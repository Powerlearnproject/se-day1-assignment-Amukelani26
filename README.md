Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

(1)Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a practice to develop, test and maintain software applications. 
It applies principles of engineering to software development, this makes sure that the applications are scalible, efficient and maintainable. 
Software engineers use programming lanuages to communicate instructions to computers. 
This process creates applications like mobile apps, 
websites and many more. Software engineering is important in the technological industry in several ways that include: increased productivity and efficiency, 
high-quatity software, enhances security, supports organisations and customers, supports innovation and growth.

(2)Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The term “software engineering” was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference was held in response to the "software crisis," where developers struggled with software complexity, cost overruns, and unreliable systems. This encouraged the use of structured programming, modular design, and software development methodologies. The birth of software engineering also led to the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline rather than an ad-hoc process.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – 1980s
The 1980s saw the widespread adoption of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java. OOP introduced the concept of organizing code into objects that interact with each other. This improved code reusability, maintainability, and scalability through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. And laid the foundation for modern software development practices, including GUI-based applications and enterprise software.
3. The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
The Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001, shifting software development away from rigid, documentation-heavy processes (like Waterfall) toward more flexible, iterative, and collaborative approaches. Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban became widely adopted. Agile project management has enhanced adaptability to changing requirements through continuous feedback loops, increased team collaboration and faster delivery of working software, and inspired DevOps practices, integrating development and operations for faster deployment and better software quality.


(3)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases that guide the development of high-quality software. Here are the key phases:
1. Planning
•	Defines the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
•	Identifies risks, resources, budget, and timelines.
•	Ensures alignment with business goals before development begins.
2. Requirements Analysis
•	Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements.
•	Engages stakeholders to ensure the software meets user needs.
•	Creates Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).
3. Design
•	Defines system architecture, components, and data flow.
•	Uses diagrams and models to outline the structure.
•	Ensures scalability, security, and performance considerations.
4. Development (Implementation)
•	Developers write the actual code based on the design.
•	Uses programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
•	Follows coding standards and best practices.
5. Testing
•	Identifies and fixes bugs to ensure software quality.
•	Uses unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
•	Validates that the software meets requirements.
6. Deployment
•	Releases the software to production or users.
•	May involve phased rollouts or full deployment.
•	Ensures smooth transition and minimal downtime.
7. Maintenance & Support
•	Fixes bugs, updates software, and improves performance.
•	Enhances features based on user feedback.
•	Ensures long-term reliability and security.
Each phase plays a crucial role in delivering efficient, secure, and user-friendly software


(4)Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has the following features: Sequential and linear, rigid; difficult to change requirements, phases completed one at a time 
(e.g., requirements → design → development → testing → deployment), limited to initial and final stages, 
done after development is completed, high risk due to late testing and feedback, extensive documentation required, 
and waterfall is slower; software is delivered at the end. 

Agile project management has the following features: Iterative and incremental, 
flexible; allows changes at any stage, continuous iterations (sprints) with frequent releases,
high; frequent feedback and collaboration, continuous testing throughout development, lower risk due to early issue detection, 
minimal documentation, focus on working software, and faster; working versions are released frequently

Scenarios Where Each Methodology is Appropriate
Waterfall is Suitable For:
1.	Projects with Well-Defined Requirements – Example: A government contract where all specifications are fixed before development begins.
2.	Highly Regulated Industries – Example: Medical or aerospace software, where compliance requires detailed documentation and structured phases.
3.	Large-Scale Infrastructure Projects – Example: Banking software updates, where changes are difficult to implement once development starts.
Agile is Suitable For:
1.	Projects with Changing Requirements – Example: A startup developing a mobile app that needs to evolve based on user feedback.
2.	Customer-Centric Applications – Example: An e-commerce website where new features are frequently introduced.
3.	Fast-Paced Environments – Example: A SaaS (Software as a Service) company developing cloud-based solutions with regular updates.


(5)Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
Role: Responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
Key Responsibilities:
•	Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
